# YCKhackathon2022
This is a sustainability hackathon I did with my older brother Ethan when he was in Primary 6 and I was in Primary 3.
We were looking at helping hawkers become more eco-friendly with 3D printed designs of Bento boxes and utensils.
In the end, we won 2th Place for the Primary/Secondary School category.
